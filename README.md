This study focuses on the oxidation of metallic aluminium and chromium trioxide (CrO3) in sub-critical and supercritical water environments to produce Cr2O3/alumina composite particles. 
The objective was to understand how variations in temperature and reaction time influence the phase composition, adsorption properties, morphology, and particle size distribution of the composites. 
Experimental investigations were carried out at temperatures ranging from 350°C to 410°C and reaction durations of 60 to 300 minutes. The process of sub- and supercritical water oxidation is exothermic, 
accompanied by hydrogen release, and leads to phase transitions in the composite particles. The smallest average particle size, davg = 46.23 μm, was achieved at a temperature of 375°C with a pressure 
of 23 MPa and a reaction time of 240 minutes. Results demonstrated that increasing the reaction temperature causes a significant reduction in the specific surface area and microporosity 
of the composite particles due to crystallization processes and structural reorgani-zation. As the temperature increases, the phase composition shifts, with a reduction in the unstable
γ- Al2O3 phase and an increase in the stable α- Al2O3 phase. The formation of nanosized chro-mium oxide (Cr2O3) particles on the porous alumina surface was confirmed by SEM and EDS analysis.
The findings suggest that subcritical and supercritical water oxidation processes offer a controlled approach for synthesizing composite materials with specific properties, such as particle 
size and phase composition, through adjustments in temperature and reaction time. These results provide valuable insights for optimizing energy-efficient methods to produce composite particles
with desired characteristics.
